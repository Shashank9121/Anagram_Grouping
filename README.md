# Anagram Grouping

This Python code allows you to input a list of elements, removes duplicates, and groups the elements based on their sorted representation. It utilizes the **defaultdict** class from the **collections** module to efficiently group the elements.
## Usage
1. To categorize and group words that are anagrams of each other.
2. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase
3. Anagram grouping can be useful in various scenarios, including: Wordgames, Cryptography, Dictionary Organisation, etc..
## Getting Started

3. Open the script file main.py in a Python editor or IDE.
4. Run the script
## Input
* Enter the number of elements you want to input.
* Provide the elements one by one when prompted.
## Output
